# iCal Generator

The restaurant I work at sends the weekly schedule through a
table on email. I have often found it inconvenient to open up my email
everytime I wanted to check it. This website will convert it into
an iCal URL that is easy and simple to import into Google Calendar.


### How to run
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
